      I specialize in systems where data accuracy and operational reliability outweigh raw speed. 
      You'll find detailed technical write-ups, architectural decisions with real tradeoffs, and working implementations 
      that demonstrate production-grade thinking — not just toy examples.

      Currently building public engineering artifacts that demonstrate senior+ systems thinking: 
      technical write-ups on data pipeline design, production tradeoff analysis, and architectural patterns that prioritize correctness. 
      Open to staff-level roles focused on data infrastructure, systems design, or platform engineering.
